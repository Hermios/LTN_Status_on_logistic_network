This mod adds new signals and associated features for the mod LTN.
When following issues occur during LTN dispatch, a signal is generated by train-stops, on its output (constant combinator):

- no train found -> signal generated by each depot associated to this network (so if x depot are associated,signal  is sent with count x)
- provider missing cargo -> signal generated by the provider
- provider unplanned cargo -> signal generated by the provider
- requester unplanned cargo -> signal generated by the requester
